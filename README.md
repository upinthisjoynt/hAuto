In the time given, I was unable to finish the connection to the DB.  I spent a good amount of time setting up my environments (M.E.A.N. & the Intern for unit tests).  As of now, all data is coming from a flat file.

So with that being said, I was able to complete 6 of the 8 items required. 

Completed:
- Page
- Dropdowns
- Models for Ford
- Models for Acura
- Content Place Holder
- Nodejs Project

Not Completed:
- Connect to Mongo
- Unit Tests
